# Saturday Java Club

## Information for Spring 2021

No club meeting 2/13 (Spring Break 1).
Next meeting: Saturday 2/20, 9 a.m.

We meet every **Saturday, at 9 a.m.,** beginning February 6.
Everyone is welcome to the Club meetings.
The setting is casual and informal.
The club is a great place for students that have just
started their adventures in programming.

The Saturday Java Club is a space to explore programming techniques, ideas,
and topics that go beyond the classroom. This term's project will be the design and development
of a text-based, interactive adventure game!

We avoid discussing homework assignments
but sometimes we use them as an opportunity
to dig a bit deeper on various topics. The last meeting will be on 4/24.

The Zoom link is: https://luc.zoom.us/j/89140806576.
The meetings are not recorded.

Bring your curiosity about programming,
a fresh cup of coffee or your favorite beverage,
and join fellow students and members of the department's
programming instructional team to learn from each other.
