# Saturday Java Club

Information for Fall 2021



Zoom ID: [870 3517 8617]( https://luc.zoom.us/j/87035178617)

*Second* meeting: Saturday 9/25/11, 9 a.m.



We meet every **other** Saturday, at 9 a.m.
Everyone is welcome to the Club meetings.
The setting is casual and informal.
The club is a great place for students that have just
started their adventures in programming.

The Saturday Java Club is a space to explore programming techniques, ideas,
and topics that go beyond the classroom. This term's project will be the design and development of a text-based, interactive adventure game!

We avoid discussing homework assignments but sometimes we use them as an opportunity to dig a bit deeper on various topics.  Bring your curiosity about programming, a fresh cup of coffee or your favorite beverage, and join fellow students and members of the department's programming instructional team to learn from each other.
