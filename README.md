# Saturday Java Club

## Information for Fall 2021

Zoom ID: [814 7264 5309](https://luc.zoom.us/j/81472645309)

*First* meeting: Saturday 9/11/21, 9 a.m.



We meet every **Saturday, at 9 a.m.
Everyone is welcome to the Club meetings.
The setting is casual and informal.
The club is a great place for students that have just
started their adventures in programming.

The Saturday Java Club is a space to explore programming techniques, ideas,
and topics that go beyond the classroom. This term's project will be the design and development
of a text-based, interactive adventure game!

We avoid discussing homework assignments
but sometimes we use them as an opportunity
to dig a bit deeper on various topics.  
Bring your curiosity about programming,
a fresh cup of coffee or your favorite beverage,
and join fellow students and members of the department's
programming instructional team to learn from each other.
